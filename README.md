# bookbot
BookBot is a word counter, and a character frequency counter. 
To use BookBot:
1) Create a new .txt file under /books directory.
2) In the newly created .txt file, paste the text.
3) In the Terminal (Linux) enter: python3 main.py <path_to_file>.
BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!
